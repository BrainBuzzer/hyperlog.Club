A community for newcoming programmers to learn new programming languages and leverage the power of resources.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone the Repo**

    Clone the given repo in a folder where you want to.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/BrainBuzzer/hyperlog.Club
    ```

1.  **Install the Dependencies**

    Navigate to the cloned directory and install the dependencies required to run the project.

    ```sh
    cd hyperlog.Club
    npm install
    ```

    > _Note: You may need to install `windows_build_tools` and `node-gyp` if you are using Windows OS._

1.  **Start developing.**

    Spin up the server from the directory.

    ```sh
    npm run develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Hyperlog.Club is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool that can be used to experiment with querying the data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `hyperlog.Club` directory in your code editor of choice. Happy Coding!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    ├── resources
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

2.  **`/resources`**: This directory contains all the tutorials and resources that you can find on the website. This directory is the core of all resources.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Hyperlog.Club is licensed under GPL-v3.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
